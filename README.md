This project uses the Spotify web API to add songs to a playlist selected by the user with the hotkey SHIFT+A

The purpose of this project is to allow users to build playlists more efficiently. The user selects a playlist they want to add 
songs to, then can browse spotify for new music. When the user finds a song they like they can press SHIFT+A and it will be 
added to the playlist without them having to click through Spotify's UI.
